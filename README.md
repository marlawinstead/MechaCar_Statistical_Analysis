## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

From the data above we can see that:

1. The vehicle length and ground clearance are likely to non-random amounts of variance to the model. Meaning, mpg is affected by vehicle length and ground clearance 


2. The p-value of our linear regression is 5.35 x 10-6, which is a significantly smaller value than the assumed significance level of 0.05. This means the slope of our linear regression model is not zero. 


3. The r-squared value is 0.7149, which indicates a strong positive relationship between predicting mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
